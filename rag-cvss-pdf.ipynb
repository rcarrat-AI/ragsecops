It was introduced with CVSS v3.0 as a key feature that captures the separation of impacts into metrics. This property allows assessment providers to record or transfer CVSS metric information using a metric value (Confidentiality High). When identifying values for impact metrics, it's crucial to consider both the effects on the vulnerable system and external impacts. These impacts are established through two sets of end game Impact metric value references."

      "The Attack Requirements (AT) refer to the minimum level of resources needed to exploit a vulnerability. This includes both technical requirements and human factors such as skill level and motivation. The CVSS v3.0 introduced this property, known as \"Attacker Complexity,\" which captures the complexity of an attacker's ability to execute an attack. It ranges from Low to High, with High indicating that the attack requires significant expertise and resources. When assessing impact metrics, it is crucial to consider both the effects on the vulnerable system and external impacts. These are measured using two sets of metrics, typically Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, and User Privileges."

This property was introduced with CVSS v3.0 as a key feature, allowing assessment providers to account for impacts both within and outside the Vulnerable System. The two sets of end game Impact metric values establish these external impacts, which can then be recorded or transferred along with CVSS metric information."
